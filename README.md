# Dart Programming Examples

This repository contains a collection of Dart programming examples covering various fundamental concepts such as data types, type conversion, control flow, and looping. The code demonstrates how to implement and use these concepts effectively.

## Project Structure

- **`lib/main.dart`**: The main entry point for the Dart program. This file combines all the functions and examples into a single executable program.
- **`lib/conversions.dart`**: Functions for type conversion, including converting between `String`, `int`, and `double`.
- **`lib/control_flow.dart`**: Functions to demonstrate control flow concepts using `if-else` statements and `switch` cases.
- **`lib/loops.dart`**: Examples of different looping constructs such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops.
- **`lib/complex_example.dart`**: A more complex example that combines data types and control flow to process a list of integers.
